## Hey there, I’m Victor 👋

I build and design software that works — clean UI, robust systems, and thoughtful code.  
Currently building **buddy.me**, contributing to **open source at GitLab**, and deepening my craft in **product design**.

---

### 💼 What I'm up to
- 🧠 Learning design from first principles (form, function, affordance, system image)
- 🛠 Working on OSS contributions at GitLab (Vue + ESLint refactors)
- 🚧 Architecting & sketching buddy.me - a gamified app for connecting like minded folks
- 🌍 Exploring infrastructure patterns & what design is beyond code

---

### 🧑‍💻 Let’s collaborate on...
- Frontend (React, TypeScript, Next.js)
- Infrastructure design (IaC, CI/CD, AWS)
- Systems with great UX (where design meets dev)
- Developer tools or indie projects

---

### 💬 Ask me about...
- Product thinking, component design, design systems  
- TypeScript + React patterns  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, AWS CDK | SDK)  
- Git workflows, DX, and documentation

### 🤖 Fun facts
- Pronounced *ray-vah* — like flavor with an R  
- I binge anime from the 90s and write poetry sometimes  
- I think in systems all day
