## Hey there, I’m Victor 👋

I build and design software that works — clean UI, robust systems, and thoughtful code.  
Currently building [**buddy.me**](https://github.com/30Piraten/buddy-me), contributing to **open source at GitLab**, and deepening my craft in **product design**.

Checkout my website: [rayvah.cc](rayvah.cc) & 
[RHIA: buddy.me's inference algorithm intro](https://rayvah.cc/posts/rabbit-hole-interface-system.html) and 
[Buddy.me's simulated user flow](https://rayvah.cc/posts/rabbit-hole-inference-algorithm-user-flow.html)

### 💼 What I'm up to
- 🧠 Learning design from first principles (form, function, affordance, system image)
- 🛠 Working on OSS contributions at GitLab (Vue + ESLint refactors, Ruby, JSX)
- 🚧 Architecting & sketching buddy.me - a gamified app for connecting like minded folks
- 🌍 Exploring infrastructure patterns & what design is beyond code

---

### 🧑‍💻 Let’s collaborate on...
- Frontend (React, TypeScript, Next.js)
- Infrastructure design (IaC, CI/CD, AWS)
- Systems with great UX (where design meets dev)
- Developer tools or indie projects

---

### 💬 Ask me about...
- Product thinking, component design, design systems  
- TypeScript + React patterns + Tooling  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, AWS CDK | SDK)  
- Git workflows, DX, and documentation
